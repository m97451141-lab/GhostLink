# GhostLink
GhostLink is a serverless tracking tool and file bridge. It generates "Chameleon Links" with spoofed social media metadata to hide real destinations. When clicked, it captures visitor IP and location data, sending live alerts to your Discord webhook. Convert files into P2P links or track URLs with total invisibility and ease.
